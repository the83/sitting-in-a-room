        <p>
          I am sitting in a room, different from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my speaking voice and I am going to play it back into the room, again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm, is destroyed. What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech. I regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have.

          It is recommended that you use a decent microphone and speakers. This will kinda "work" with a phone or laptop mic/speakers, but probably won't sound very good.
